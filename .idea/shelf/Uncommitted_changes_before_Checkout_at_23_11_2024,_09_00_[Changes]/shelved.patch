Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused. In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust\\'s A la Recherche du temps perdu, Mann\\'s Death in Venice, Tolstoy\\'s War and Peace, and Freud\\'s case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that all narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn\\'s Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, The Distinction of Fiction builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, NULL, 1, 'Dorrit Cohn', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-11', 37),\r\n                                                                                                                                  ('John Fowles\\'s Fiction and the Poetics of Postmodernism', 10, 'Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader\\'s position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant\\'s Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles\\'s nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, 'Language Arts & Disciplines', 23, 'Mahmoud Salami', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EquizXeXb3kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-13', 62),\r\n                                                                                                                                  ('Handbook of Formative Assessment in the Disciplines', 10, 'The Handbook of Formative Assessment in the Disciplines meaningfully addresses current developments in the field, offering a unique and timely focus on domain dependency.

As supporters of large-scale testing programs increasingly consider the potential of formative assessments to improve teaching and learning, this handbook advances the subject through novel frameworks, intersections of theory, research, and practice, and attention to discernible disciplines.

While supernatural short fiction of the Americas belongs to the broad category of the fantastic, which is generally approached synchronically, reading audiences of the past 200 years have shifted their beliefs about the supernatural several times. While nineteenth-century readers understood science as real and the supernatural as imaginary, modern audiences recognize both as inaccurate, a shift which allows authors of supernatural fiction to celebrate premodern indigenous beliefs which were once disdained by a materialist culture. This book situates supernatural short fiction of the Americas within the changing cultural and epistemological contexts of the last 200 years and explores how authors have drawn upon a wealth of indigenous traditions. The book begins with a discussion of theories of the supernatural and the fantastic. It then looks at some of the first encounters of European and Native American supernatural beliefs and points to the common elements of these early traditions. The volume next focuses on American literature of the nineteenth century, which has a complex fusion of materialist biases and metaphysical fascinations.

From Ishmael\\'s insistence in Herman Melville\\'s Moby-Dick that a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard, to the unnamed narrator\\'s expulsion from his southern college in Ralph Ellison\\'s Invisible Man, the most frequently taught books in the English curriculum tend to be those that cast the school as a stultifying and inhumane social institution. Why have educators preferred the anti-scholasticism of the American romance tradition to the didacticism of sentimentalists? Why have they organized African American literature as a discursive category around texts that despaired of the post-Reconstruction institutional system? Why did they start teaching novels, that literary form whose very nature, in Mikhail Bakhtin\\'s words, is not canonic? Reading literature in class is a paradoxical undertaking that, according to Day Frank, has proved foundational to the development of American formal education over the last two centuries, allowing the school to claim access to a social world external to itself. By drawing attention to the transformative effect literature has had on the school, Schools of Fiction challenges some of our core assumptions about the nature of cultural administration and the place of English in the curriculum. The educational system, Day Frank argues, has depended historically on the cultural objects whose existence it is ordinarily thought to govern and the academic subject it is ordinarily thought to have marginalized.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, 'Education', 32, 'Morgan Day Frank', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvegEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-15', 1),\r\n                                                                                                                                  ('Genesis: History, Fiction, or Neither?', 10, 'The nature of the Genesis narrative has sparked much debate among Christians.

Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused. In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust\'s A la Recherche du temps perdu, Mann\'s Death in Venice, Tolstoy\'s War and Peace, and Freud\'s case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that all narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn\'s Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, The Distinction of Fiction builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, NULL, 1, 'Dorrit Cohn', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-11', 37),

The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles\'s nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, 'Language Arts & Disciplines', 23, 'Mahmoud Salami', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EquizXeXb3kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-13', 62),

Building from an updated definition of formative assessment, the book covers the integration of measurement principles into practice; the operationalization of formative assessment within specific domains, beyond generic strategies; evolving research directions including student involvement and self-regulation; and new approaches to the challenges of incorporating formative assessment training into pre-service and in-service educator training. As supporters of large-scale testing programs increasingly consider the potential of formative assessments to improve teaching and learning, this handbook advances the subject through novel frameworks, intersections of theory, research, and practice, and attention to discernible disciplines. Written for instructors, graduate students, researchers, and policymakers, each chapter provides expert perspectives on the procedures and evaluations that enable teachers to adapt teaching and learning in-process toward student achievement.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, 'Education', 24, 'Heidi L.

These authorized collections--which include works from the entire range of Fitzgerald\'s career, from his undergraduate days at Princeton to his final contributions to Esquire magazine--provide an ideal overview of his development as a short story writer. Originally published in 1989, this volume draws upon Fitzgerald\'s copious personal correspondence, biographical studies, and all available criticism, and analyzes how Fitzgerald perceived his achievements as a writer of short fiction from both artistic and commercial standpoints.

While supernatural short fiction of the Americas belongs to the broad category of the fantastic, which is generally approached synchronically, reading audiences of the past 200 years have shifted their beliefs about the supernatural several times. While nineteenth-century readers understood science as real and the supernatural as imaginary, modern audiences recognize both as inaccurate, a shift which allows authors of supernatural fiction to celebrate premodern indigenous beliefs which were once disdained by a materialist culture. This book situates supernatural short fiction of the Americas within the changing cultural and epistemological contexts of the last 200 years and explores how authors have drawn upon a wealth of indigenous traditions. The book begins with a discussion of theories of the supernatural and the fantastic. It then looks at some of the first encounters of European and Native American supernatural beliefs and points to the common elements of these early traditions. The volume next focuses on American literature of the nineteenth century, which has a complex fusion of materialist biases and metaphysical fascinations.

Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused. In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust\'s A la Recherche du temps perdu, Mann\'s Death in Venice, Tolstoy\'s War and Peace, and Freud\'s case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that all narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn\'s Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, The Distinction of Fiction builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.', 'somewhere in library', '2015', 200, NULL, '1', 'Dorrit Cohn', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2024-11-11', 37),

The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent.
